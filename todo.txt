DEBUG FEATURES:
- frame stepping / rewinding

SIMULATION:
- correct handling of pressure field
- external forces
- boundary conditions
- generate good initial conditions
- higher order advection term (particle tracer)
- better defined frame-update loop
- framerate independence
- seperate kernel for boundary elements

PERFORMANCE:
- profile!
    - then probably optimize poisson solver
- asynchronous sim update procedure (may cause issues with GL)
- choose a good kernel block size (expect something like 16,16,1)
