DEBUG FEATURES:
- gui for controlling debug view
- frame stepping / rewinding

SIMULATION:
- higher order advection term (particle tracer)
- use unfiltered texture fetches and do trilinear filtering in kernel code?
- better defined frame-update loop
- framerate independence
- seperate kernel for boundary elements

PERFORMANCE:
- choose a good kernel block size (expect something like 16,16,1)
